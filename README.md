## About

This is a a small ReactJS application that allows a user to search for a wine, then display its details. It retrieves data from a [REST API](https://github.com/PhillipeAlves/wine_api) built as part of this project.

It features a live search system based on the informations fetched asynchronous from the API. When an item from the list is clicked/tapped, navigate to a view showing the basic details of a wine, as well as allowing the user to see the Year, Variety, Region and Year + Variety breakdown.

The data is stored using Redux Store.
